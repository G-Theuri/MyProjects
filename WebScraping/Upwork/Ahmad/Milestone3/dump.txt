api link = 

Thoughts
1. Get API link to all SubCategories.
2. Under the JSON file, I will find Links to individual Collection.
4. Collect the Category name, SubCategory name and Collection name.
5. Follow each individual collection and get its data.
6. Sort on pagination because items are loaded dynamically.
