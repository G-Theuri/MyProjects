api link = 

Thoughts
1. Get API link to all SubCategories.
2. Under the JSON file, I will find Links to individual Collection.
4. Collect the Category name, SubCategory name and Collection name.
5. Follow each individual collection and get its data.
6. Sort on pagination because items are loaded dynamically.

To-Do:
Here is an example url for items in every product page
url = https://www.elkhome.com/api/v2/products?categoryid=82016b6f-8ba3-4ca2-92ac-ad49015f64b7&page=10
Here is how I will format it:

url = f'https://www.elkhome.com/api/v2/products?categoryid={id}&page={pageNumber}'

If a SubCategory does not have a collection, then the {id} is equal to the the SubCategory id which will be parsed 
from the alldata dictionary.

If a SubCategory have a collection then the {id} is the collection id.
This too shall be parse from the alldata dict.

Every product page json has 'pagination' as a key and under it 'totalItemCount' which tell you
how many items there are in every page. 
Therefore, first get the initial page the query the json to know how many items there
are for that link and divided it by 24. This will help you know whether you should prompt a next page request.

Info from the product page found in the json file is limited. Think about that.


NB. Kindly work on the globalviews pagination
